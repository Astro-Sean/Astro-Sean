Hi, I'm **SeÃ¡n**, an astronomer at the [Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University, Sweden](https://www.okc.albanova.se/). My research focuses on mass loss from massive stars and interacting transients.

Currently, I'm investigating pre-supernova progenitor activity to gain deeper insights into what happens in the final weeks to months of a massive star's life, leading up to core collapse.

Open-source code fosters transparency, enables peer review, and enhances reproducibility. If any of the code featured in [my publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FBrennan%2C%20S%2FBrennan%2C%20S%20%20J%22&filter_database_fq_database=AND&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FBrennan%2C%20S%2FBrennan%2C%20S%20%20J%22)&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&q=author%3A%22S.%20J.%20Brennan%22%20%20year%3A2018-3000&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) could benefit your research or projects, feel free to reach out!
