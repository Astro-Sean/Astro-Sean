### Hi, Se√°n is ainm dom! :ireland:


I am a final year PhD student at University College Dublin in Ireland. 

My research focuses on modelling powerful explosions such as Supernovae, and study how this explosions look when surrounded by dense dust and gas.

For the time being, I'm finishing up my main PhD topic, the [AutoPHoT](https://github.com/Astro-Sean/autophot) pipeline. If you have a lot of images lying around that you don't have the time to sit down and do photometry on, check it out!
