 
I'm Se√°n, an astronomer at [the Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University, Sweden](https://www.okc.albanova.se/), researching mass loss from massive stars, and interacting transients.

My current work is focused on searching for pre-supernova, progenitor activity to better understand what a massive star does in it's final weeks - months before core-collapse.

Open source code improves transparancy, scrutiny, and reproducability,- if code shown in [my work](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FBrennan%2C%20S%2FBrennan%2C%20S%20%20J%22&filter_database_fq_database=AND&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FBrennan%2C%20S%2FBrennan%2C%20S%20%20J%22)&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&q=author%3A%22S.%20J.%20Brennan%22%20%20year%3A2018-3000&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) can aid in your science case, contact me at [seanbrennan@astro.su.se](mailto:seanbrennan@astro.su.se).
