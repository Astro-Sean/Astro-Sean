Hi, I'm **Seán**, an astronomer at the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main) in Garching bei München, Germany. My research explores mass loss from massive stars and the nature of interacting transients.

**Research Focus**
I'm interested in the final stages of massive stellar evolution—investigating pre-supernova activity to better understand what happens in the weeks to months before core collapse. My broader research spans:

* High-energy astrophysical transients, especially interacting systems and their spectral signatures
* Multi-wavelength photometric analysis using instruments like MPI 2.2m/GROND
* X-ray studies with [eROSITA](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA) and the [Einstein Probe](https://www.einsteinprobe.org/)
* Developing tools and methods to detect early-time progenitor variability ahead of next-gen surveys like [LSST](https://www.lsst.org/)

**Open Science & Software**
Open-source development is a cornerstone of transparent and reproducible science. Many of the tools I build are designed to support transient discovery and photometric analysis workflows.
