### Hi, SeÃ¡n is ainm dom! :ireland:
 

Hello! I'm SeÃ¡n, an astronomer at [Alba Nova, Stockholm University, Sweden](https://www.albanova.se/), specializing in the study of mass Loss from massive stars, Superluminous Supernovae, and interacting transients. My current work is focused on finding stars and observing them in their final moments before their explosive deaths as supernova.
