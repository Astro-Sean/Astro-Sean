### Hi, Se√°n is ainm dom!


I am a final year PhD student at University College Dublin in Ireland. I am interested in astronomical transients, especially those that show signatures of interaction with dense material. In the future I want to focus on modelling extreme astronomical explosions such as supernovae, and study how this explosions look when surrounded by dense dust and gas, particularly in a non-symmetric setting!

For the time being I'm finishing up my main PhD topic, the [AutoPHoT](https://github.com/Astro-Sean/autophot) code.

I'm searching for an interesting Post-Doc, if you have an opening and want to collaborate, send me an email!
